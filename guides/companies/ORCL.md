## Known Quirks

- Oracle uses its own HCM Cloud product (dogfooding their ATS).
- The portal URL often starts with `eeho.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com`.
- UI is Oracle's modern Redwood design system.
- Some legacy roles may still use Taleo (Oracle's older ATS).
- Oracle is a major H-1B sponsor.
- The form uses Oracle-specific components, not standard HTML.

## Platform Guide

Refer to [Custom ATS Guide](../custom-ats.md) for general strategies. Oracle HCM Cloud behaves similarly to Workday in structure — see [Workday ATS Guide](../workday.md) for conceptual parallels.
